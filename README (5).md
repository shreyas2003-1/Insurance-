# Insurance Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applies machine learning models to an insurance dataset.

## Features
- Data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Missing data analysis with Missingno.
- Machine learning models including SVM and Naive Bayes.

## Installation
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis.

## Files
- `Insurance.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook
- `insurance.csv` - Dataset (not included, upload separately)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `.gitignore` - Ignore unnecessary files

## Workflow
1. Load and preprocess data.
2. Perform EDA with visualizations.
3. Train machine learning models.
4. Evaluate and interpret results.
